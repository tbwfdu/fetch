You can upload an existing application inventory report in **.csv** format with only 3 columns in the following order (with headers):

*‚Äúapp_name‚Äù*, *‚Äúapp_package_id‚Äù* & *‚Äúapp_version‚Äù* (this is the naming standard from Workspace ONE Intelligence). 

Fetch will then process this file and give you the results of what it has in its database vs. the report.

:information_source: The results will load _incrementally_ when scrolling to the last item in the current view.

An *‚ÄúExact Match‚Äù* is where Fetch has matched the App Name with the exact same version from its database. A partial match is where it has found the application by name, but could not match on an exact file version.

By default, the results list only shows Exact or Partial Matches. You can change the Filter to show all results (include No Match) and if you want you can remove a result from the list using the `x` icon. On a *Partial* or *Exact Match* result, you can click the ‚Äú**+**‚Äù icon and add the Application to the Upload Queue if desired.

:information_source:

Once you have added an application to the queue, you can right-click on the Application entry and either remove it from the queued items or edit the default Configuration Parameters used to create the application in the Workspace ONE Catalog.

When editing the application configuration, you can edit the available options by clicking the edit button next to the entry.

**_NOTE:_**

:chart_with_upwards_trend: **Scalability:** Fetch has been tested by importing and processing application inventories of up to 5000 applications.
